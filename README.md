# Data-Analytics
Projects demonstrating Skills:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 T20 World Cup cricket tournament, leveraging advanced data extraction techniques from ESPNcricinfo. Through meticulous web scraping procedures and proficient data cleaning utilizing Python's Pandas library, I curated a rich dataset encompassing player statistics, match outcomes, and team performances. Subsequently, employing the powerful visualization capabilities of Power BI, I crafted insightful dashboards to distil complex cricketing insights and facilitate strategic decision-making. This endeavour aimed to construct an optimal playing 11 team capable of competing against extraterrestrial adversaries, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis, web scraping, and visualization tools.



Project 01: T20 Cricket World Cup 2022.

In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 T20 World Cup cricket tournament, leveraging advanced data extraction techniques from ESPNcricinfo.

This endeavour aimed to construct an optimal playing 11 team capable of competing against extraterrestrial adversaries, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis, web scraping, and visualization tools."

Preprocessing:

 

I first extracted the datasets through the ESPNcricinfo website utilizing a tool named Bright Data. After scraping the data, pre-processing was done on batting, bowling, and player's information CSV file and cleaned files were saved.

​

Snippets of all three files:
These are the dashboards created to find the best players for each position based on the parameters needed:

    The given parameters were:

           1. Batting Average:  >  30.

           2.  Batting position : =< 3.

           3. Strike rate: < 140.

           4. Total Innings batted: < 3.

           5. Boundary % :  < 50.

​

All the parameters were selected based on the analysis and the requirement for the score to make it easy to choose the best players
Below are the dashboards for openers, middle-order batsmen, power hitters, and the best fast and spin bowlers according to the options.

​

Dashboard for the openers:

Based on the table within the parameters, I selected 2 English batsmen for openings based on strike rates and a good average.

​

Dashboard for Middle Order:

​Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav were drafted into the middle order for their consistent runs at a higher strike rate along with Glenn Philips as a wicketkeeper.

​

Dashboards of lower order:

Marcus Stoinis was chosen due to the fact he can hit runs quickly at an astounding strike rate of 161.54 and can also bowl 1- 2 overs if needed in crucial stages. Sikandar Raza made it because of the wickets he took while maintaining a good bowling strike rate.

​

Dashboard of spinners:

Shadab Khan had highest with the players with parameters which was the reason for his selection in playing 11.
Now we had just 3 positions vacant with 2 spinners already there we will choose 3 fast bowlers.

​
Dashboard for Fast bowlers:

We have selected Sam curran, Anrich Nortje and Shaheen shah Afridi due to high wickets, Avg and exceptional strike rate.
